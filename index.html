                    C++ is a general-purpose programming language 
                    created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension 
                    of the C programming language, or "C with 
                    Classes". The language has expanded significantly 
                    over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, 
                    generic, and functional features in addition to 
                    facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 
                    It is almost always implemented as a compiled 
                    language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, 
                    including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, 
                    Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is 
                    available on many platforms.

                    C++ is standardized by the International Organization 
                    for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard 
                    version ratified and published by ISO in December 
                    2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). 
                    The C++ programming language was initially standardized 
                    in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by 
                    the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current 
                    C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an 
                    enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization 
                    in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist 
                    Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension 
                    of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible 
                    language similar to C that also provided high-level features 
                    for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a 
                    three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned 
                    standard.
