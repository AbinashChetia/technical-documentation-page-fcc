                    C++ is a general-purpose programming language 
                    created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension 
                    of the C programming language, or "C with 
                    Classes". The language has expanded significantly 
                    over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, 
                    generic, and functional features in addition to 
                    facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 
                    It is almost always implemented as a compiled 
                    language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, 
                    including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, 
                    Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is 
                    available on many platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C++ is standardized by the International Organization 
                    for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard 
                    version ratified and published by ISO in December 
                    2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). 
                    The C++ programming language was initially standardized 
                    in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by 
                    the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current 
                    C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an 
                    enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization 
                    in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist 
                    Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension 
                    of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible 
                    language similar to C that also provided high-level features 
                    for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a 
                    three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned 
                    standard.

                    Although C++ is considered to be one of the best programming 
                    languages for absolute beginners, but prior knowledge of C 
                    programming greatly helps while learning C++. Its because C++ 
                    can be considered as just an extension of C with the ability 
                    to perform Object Oriented Programming. Moreover, a programming 
                    and problem-solving mindset is the most essential component of 
                    learning any programming language.

                    Also, in the technical side, to run a C++ program, a C/C++ compiler is 
                    the most important thing to have. More regarding this is discussed 
                    later in the <a class="main-doc-link" href="#C/C++_Compiler">
                    C/C++ Compiler</a> section. Of course, to write a program, a text 
                    editor like <a class="main-doc-link" href="https://www.vim.org" target="_blank">Vim</a> 
                    is the minimum requirement.

                    As mentioned earlier, C and C++ are closely related. 
                    In fact, C++ was created as an extension of C, but 
                    additionally having the capability to perform Object 
                    Oriented Programming due to its concept of classes and 
                    objects. They are so much closely realted that most of 
                    the times, C and C++ are taken into consideration together.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, after its genesis, C++ have come a long way to its 
                    present state. This has brought a significant amount of 
                    differences between C++ and its sibling, C. Differences in 
                    the sense of they function differently and have pretty 
                    significant differences in their syntaxes.

                    Although there are many online C/C++ compilers available, 
                    only a limited number of offline/local compilers are in 
                    use at present. In fact, the online compilers too use these 
                    local compilers in backend. These compilers include: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a id="main-doc-link" href="https://gcc.gnu.org" target="_blank">GCC</a></li>
                    <li><a id="main-doc-link" href="https://clang.llvm.org" target="_blank">Clang</a></li>
                    <li><a id="main-doc-link" href="https://mingw-w64.org" target="_blank">MinGW</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These, compilers need to be installed properly in the machine for 
                    it to compile and run C++ programs. However, using IDE like 
                    <a id="main-doc-link" href="https://www.bloodshed.net/" 
                    target="_blank">Dev-C++</a> doesn't exclusively require a 
                    compiler to be installed, as the IDE itself comes with a compiler 
                    in its package.
